# Environment Provider - Datasources

After declaring the Environment provider, you can define as many Terraform Datasources as Environment variables you need to use.
You can also define a Datasource that will return a list of Environment variables.
Mark the Datasource as sensitive if you don't want the value of the Environment variable to be displayed during plan/apply.
